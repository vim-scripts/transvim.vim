This script looks up a word/phrase in a dictionary.
User can press key-shortcuts to translate word under cursor, visually selected 
text or to be asked for a word.

Search-results are viewed in the same window in which searching
was started. To close a view, press 'q' - TransVim will then
switch back to the buffer comming from.

There are several possibilities to start a translation:
  1) move cursor over word to be translated and press <Leader>tr
  2) visually select word to be translated and press <Leader>tr
  3) press <Leader>ta to be prompted for a word
Memory aid: tr = (T)(R)anslate, ta = (T)ranslate (A)sk for word

By default <Leader> is \, so press \tr, \ta to start  translation.

In order to prevent tremendous huge search-results, the search-string must be at
least 3 characters long (min. length is configurable).
